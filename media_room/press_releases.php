Josekutty P.D, Principal, elaborated on the importance of education on the overall development of an individual. He mentioned that education can only be fruitful when one realizes the real attitudes and values in life coupled with continuous strive for excellence. Kristu Jayanti College aims at the continuous and comprehensive training in knowledge and skills along with morale training, thus motivating the students to achieve their life goals. “The college purposes to empower every student, to make them realize their potential, so that in the future they can empower others in their life,” he added.</p>

They stand for Resourcefulness, Responsibility and Respectability. When a student is resourceful, he is keeping up to the expectations of his parents and teachers. Being resourceful alone cannot make a person complete, one needs to have the courage to take up responsibilities, at the same time giving and taking respect. “When these three elements are blended together, you will be molding yourself for the future challenges in life,” reminded the Principal.</p>

Ltd., as she addressed the Post Graduate girl students at the International Women’s Day celebrations, organized by the Women Empowerment Cell of Kristu Jayanti College on March 8, 2017.</p>

                                                        <p align=justify>Rev. Fr. Augustine George, in his address emphasized on the inner strength within every woman. “There is divinity within ourselves, Honour and respect that divinity,” he said. He further said that no one can change the situation that one is in, except that person themselves.</p>

                                                        <p align=justify>There was a cultural program in the morning where iconic women who have had an impact on the world were celebrated. The function later in the day consisted of an inspirational talk by Ms. Salma Moosa, followed by a workshop on self-defense for the women conducted by the School of Martial Arts.</p>

                                                        <p align=justify>Ms. Moosa, in her inspirational talk gave three points for the gathering. The first, she said, was to be oneself, and to do what one wants one to do. The second was to start doing what one wants to do in small things. And the final point from her was that women don’t need empowerment, but need to start respecting each other.</p>

                                                        <p align=justify>The workshop on self-defense for the Post Graduate women students was conducted by a team from the School of Martial Arts, led by Master Poondhanam, Senior Black Belt, and Master Balraj, Senior Black Belt, Senior Black Belt. They taught 30 basic techniques of self-defense within a period of one hour, preparing the students for the dangers they might encounter on the road.</p>
