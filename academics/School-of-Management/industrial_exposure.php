								<p><b>INDUSTRIAL VISIT TO UNIBIC BISCUITS INDIA PVT. LTD.</b><br>
									<b>Date:</b> 06- Aug - 2014</p>
								<center><img src="images/unibic_visited.jpg"></center>

								<p align=justify>On the 6th August 2014, the department of management studies had organized an industrial visit for over 100 students, headed by two of the faculties of the department - Prof. Ragesh and Prof. Arul Senthilkumar. The I MBA students of 2014-2016 were thrilled to have gotten the opportunity for their very first Industrial visit which was to Unibic Biscuits India Pvt. Ltd., Heggadadevanapura Village, Huskur Road, Alur Po, Dasanapura Hobli, Bangalore North Taluk, (Near Nelmangala) Bangalore.</p>

								<p align=justify>Unibic has been manufacturing and marketing premium cookies in India since 2004 and operates as a subsidiary of Unibic Australia Pvt. Ltd. With Bangalore unit being the only unit in India. This Unit is equipped with the state-of-the-art machines from Italy. It is the first biscuit company to have put up a "wire cutting" technology which provides superior quality products and is the only method available to make real cookie. The Company has also installed equipment and packaging machinery for exports. The unit is capable of producing the around 30 tons products per day.</p>

								<p align=justify>Students were divided in group of 30 and were taken for the tour of the unit to understand the Manufacturing process. Firstly, they were taken to the Raw Material storing are where they were briefed about the raw materials required for the production. Next was the Pre-mixing segment where ingredients are pre- treated followed by Mixing them. Next, Forming Stage where cookies are made was explained. Baking is done at 220 C after which the cooled baked cookies are moved to Packaging segments where the highly efficient machines could pack around 120 packages per minute.</p>

								<p align=justify>HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) certification has been done and recently they have obtained BRC (British Retailers Consortium) certification. Students were delighted to be informed that each time one buys a packet of Unibic ANZAC cookies, money is being raised to provide support to India's war widows, as well as the Indian JAWANS who risk their lives for us every day. UNIBIC donates 3% of sales for the support of Indian veterans.</p>

								<p align=justify>Students were amazed at the speed at which the process occurred and how the automated systems could work according to the requirements. The highly informative visit concluded on a sweet note as the students were offered complimentary cookies to munch on. The industrial visit to Unibic Biscuits India Pvt. Ltd. was an enriching experience for students in getting live exposure of manufacturing which can help them in their internships and further career enhancements.</p>

								<p><b>International Industrial Visit Singapore & Malaysia</b><br>
									<b>Date:</b> july 02nd to 09th - 2014</p>

								<p align=justify>The 2nd year students of MBA/PGDM (2013-15) were given the opportunity to expose themselves to the International stage. A team of 80 members including three faculty and one tourist guide left for Singapore. Our college had given us the platform to raise our vision to a higher level.</p>

								<p align=justify>We were asked to report in the college premises on 02nd July at 5:00 am, as our flight was scheduled at 9:30 am IST at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIAL). After the 5 hour long journey, we landed in Changi Airport, Singapore at 5:00 pm local time.</p>

<p>Singapore, the World's costliest city, known for its clean and disciplined culture got us amazed at first sight. We were taken to various tourist attractions-<br>
Jurong Bird Park<br>
Sentosa Island<br>
Universal Studios<br>
Merlion<br>
	NEWater (water treatment plant)</p>

								<p align=justify>These were not merely attractions but everyplace we visited was systematic and disciplined. This helped us to understand and observe management functions in every aspect. We were given a fantastic accommodation & our stay at Singapore lasted 3 nights.</p>

								<p align=justify>Our next destination was Malaysia. We took the road transport to get there in just 5 hours. Malaysia is also known for its discipline and systematic way of life. Both countries have a lot of South Indian settlement, people, who were taken to work in the 1800's by the British Official languages are English, Mandarin & Tamil in both Singapore and Malaysia. The latter has a large Bangladeshi & Pakistani population who are primarily running small and medium businesses.</p>

<p>Malaysia has its own tourist attractions to boast about and also known for its tall buildings. Some of the attractions were-<br>
PETRONAS twin towers<br>
Istana Negara (The King's palace)<br>
Sunway Lagoon<br>
The Royal Selangoor<br>
Watch Emporium<br>
	Nasional Sports Stadium</p>

								<p align=justify>We left for Singapore after two nights in Malaysia by air and boarded the Singapore-Bangalore flight at 19:45 hours local time. We arrived at the KIAL, Bangalore at 21:45 hours on 09-July.</p>

								<p align=justify>Every place we visited had its own specialty and the learnings were equally good as the fun factor. We were able to experience how the International Cultures work and live. There are infinite memories and learnings we brought back home. This has helped us to discipline our lives and career in every aspect. We thank our College Management and the faculty in-charge for arranging this International Program so that every student got a glimpse of International Culture.</p>
