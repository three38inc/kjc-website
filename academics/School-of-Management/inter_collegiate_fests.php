								<p>The T.John Institute of Management and Science (TIMS), conducted a National Conference on 9th December 2014, which dealt with Inclusive & Sustainable Growth For Emerging Economies Like India.

Track 1: Challenges in Indian and Global Economy<br>
Track 2: Challenges in Accounting and Finance<br>
